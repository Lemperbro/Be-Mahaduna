### Documentation

Documentation can be found on the [official website](https://log-viewer.opcodes.io/).

## Get Started

### Requirements

- **PHP 8.0+**
- **Laravel 8+**

### Installation

To install the package via composer, Run:

```bash
composer require opcodesio/log-viewer
```

After installing the package, publish the front-end assets by running:

```bash
php artisan log-viewer:publish
```

### Usage

Once the installation is complete, you will be able to access **Log Viewer** directly in your browser.

By default, the application is available at: `{APP_URL}/log-viewer`.

(for example: `https://my-app.test/log-viewer`)

## Configuration

Please visit the **[Log Viewer Docs](https://log-viewer.opcodes.io/docs)** to learn about configuring Log Viewer to your needs.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems and solutions.

### Problem: Logs not loading

Please see [this page](https://log-viewer.opcodes.io/docs/3.x/log-types/default) for support log formats. If your log has a custom format, or is not supported by Log Viewer out of the box, you will need to [define your own custom log parser](https://log-viewer.opcodes.io/docs/3.x/log-types/custom).

If your logs are still not showing up, make sure the web process, which Log Viewer runs on, has permission to read these logs.

For example, if you want to read the Apache HTTP access logs in `/var/log/httpd`, you will need to make sure that your web process (apache/httpd) has permission to read these files. On unix systems, you can do this with [file ACLs](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/unix-linux-access-control-lists-acls-basics/#:~:text=Every%20file%20on%20any%20UNIX,their%20permission%20to%20the%20file).
